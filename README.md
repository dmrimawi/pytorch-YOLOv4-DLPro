# Instruction to run the Code

Title: Object Shape and Color Detection

Students: Diaeddin Rimawi & Zeeshan Hameed

Professor: Prof. Oswald Lanz

TA: Pietro Buzzega


The code on Github for reference, however, to run the training and the inference code. Both Colab notebooks can be used.

To correctly run the Colab code:

1. Visit the dataset repo, which is made public, then by going to the dataset tab > select download > select YOLOv4 PyTorch as the format > choose show download code > Open the terminal tab > copy the dataset link.
Dataset Repo: https://universe.roboflow.com/diaeddin-rimawi/objects-shapes-and-colors

2. Open the colab code, either training or testing notebook and make a copy on your drive, then update the link where is written "LinkHere" with the copied link from RoboFlow, then you can run the notebook, with a standard GPU and a standard Memory.
